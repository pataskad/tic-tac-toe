# Tic Tac Toe #

[Live Demo Coming Soon]()

# Learning Outcomes #

The 'Tic Tac Toe' project, based from within the 'The Odin Project' curriculum, is my another step in further expanding my expertise when it comes to JavaScript and all it has to offer.  This project focuses on primarily working with Factory Functions, Modules, and IIFE's while making them communicate to become a more efficient and industry grade codebase to generate this tic tac toe game.  This project will occasionally be updated and refactored as I learn more and continue to grow as a developer.  

Additionally, while simple in concept this kind of project is another stepping stone in solidifying core JavaScript fundamental concepts that are important to understand and implement to be successful and respected within the industry, plus they are fascinating!

# Running Locally #

I recommend utilizing the Live Server extension housed within VSCode's extensive extension database to easily read and view the application in an real-time environment.  This allows determines a straight forward and quick method to view any changes to the app if so desired.
