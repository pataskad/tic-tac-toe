# Tic Tac Toe #

[Live Demo Coming Soon]()

# Learning Outcomes #

The 'Tic Tac Toe' project, based from within the 'The Odin Project' curriculum, is the first pass at writing more efficient JavaScript code utilizing methods such as revealing module patterns to make effective use of closures, factory functions where necessary to create new objects, and overall improved code structure to continue preparing for large scale applications within the professional development industry.

In addition, this project will continue to enhance my overall design and implementation skills as well as speed to better prepare for professional workloads.

# Running Locally #

I recommend utilizing the Live Server extension housed within VSCode's extensive extension database to easily read and view the application in an real-time environment.  This allows determines a straight forward and quick method to view any changes to the app if so desired.
